Installation

You're using Ubuntu 12.04, aren't you? I am.

1. sudo apt-get install ruby1.9
2. gem1.9 install bundler
3. bundle install

Notes
-----

* Recommend using RVM rather than the system ruby.
* Doesn't work on ruby 1.8
* Require a mysql connection, yutar@127.0.0.1/yutar (no password)
 * Will be replaced soon by a sqlite one for testing purpose.
